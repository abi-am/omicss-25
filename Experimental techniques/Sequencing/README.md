# Introduction: NGS and Long Read Sequencing Classes

Welcome to the sessions on **Next-Generation Sequencing Technologies** and **Long Read Sequencing**. These two consecutive classes will provide an overview of modern sequencing technologies, with a focus on both short-read and long-read approaches, their applications, advantages, and limitations.

## About the Topics

### Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) refers to high-throughput technologies that allow rapid sequencing of entire genomes, transcriptomes, or targeted regions. NGS has revolutionized molecular biology, enabling diverse applications in genomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, and beyond. Unlike traditional Sanger sequencing, NGS produces millions of reads in parallel, increasing both speed and data output while reducing cost.

### Generations of Sequencing Technologies

- **First Generation**: Sanger sequencing – accurate but low-throughput and expensive for large-scale studies.
- **Second Generation (Short-read sequencing)**: Platforms like Illumina that generate massive amounts of short reads with high accuracy and efficiency. Widely used for resequencing, RNA-Seq, and more.
- **Third Generation (Long-read sequencing)**: Single-molecule sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio, which produce much longer reads. Ideal for resolving structural variants, complex regions, and full-length transcripts.

### Long Read Sequencing

Long read sequencing enables the generation of reads that span thousands to even millions of bases. This improves the assembly of genomes, phasing of haplotypes, and identification of structural variants. While error rates can be higher compared to short-read platforms, ongoing improvements in chemistry and computational correction methods have significantly enhanced their utility.
