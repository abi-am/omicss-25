# SOP
1. Each topic should have its folder.
2. When creating a folder, first create it's README.md
3. Each folder should have a README with:
  - The primary contributor/manager
  - The contributing authors
  - The description of its content
  - README template:
```
  # Contributors
    Primary contributor: [NAME SURNAME]
    Contributing authors: [NAME SURNAME] [NAME SURNAME] [NAME SURNAME]
  # Contents  
  # TODO
    Primary contributor assigns tasks to contributing authors with deadlines
```
4. The following materials should be uploaded:
  - Lecture slides & notes
  - Exercises & tasks for practicals AND/OR notes describing the location of respective files on the server
5. Each folder can have a subfolder for separate topics. Subfolders inherit all the rules applicable to folders. 
6. Commit messages should either be:
  - "Complete"
  - "In progress: xx%" (indicate the percentage of completeness of the overall folder or a subfolder)
