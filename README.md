# SOP
1. Each topic should have its folder.
2. When creating a folder, first create it's README.md
3. Each folder should have a README with:
  - The author name and email
  - The description of its content
4. Commit messages should either be:
  - "Complete"
  - "In progress: xx%" (indicate the percentage of completeness)
