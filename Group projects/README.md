## GP1: Machine Learning-Based Identification of Bacterial Biomarkers for Disease Classification
 - Mentors: Davit Hakobyan, Nelli Vardazaryan, Razmik Sargsyan, Lusine Adunts
 - Students (will be added)
 - Short description: This project aims to identify bacterial biomarkers with disease classification potential using microbial abundance data from WGS/Shotgun metagenomics data. Students will apply tools like ANCOM-BC2 and machine learning models, and may also be involved in preprocessing raw sequencing data to generate OTU tables.
 
## GP2: Discovery of Telomeric Biomarkers for Cancer Detection in Cell-Free DNA
 - Mentors: Tatevik Jalatyan,	Anahit Yeghiazaryan, Davit Tareverdyan, Mher Kurghinyan
 - Students (will be added)
 - Short description: This project explores telomeric sequences in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) to discover novel biomarkers for early cancer detection and monitoring. Students will process raw cfDNA sequencing data, identify telomeric repeat variants, derive gene expression signals from cfDNA, and analyze telomere maintenance mechanism pathway activity. Statistical tests will be used to compare cancer and healthy samples across public datasets.
 
## GP3: Genomic Characterization of Population Structure in Caucasian Grape Varieties Using Whole-Genome Sequencing
 - Mentors: Nate Zadirako, Mariia Arakelian, Nane Pivazyan
 - Students (will be added)
 - Short description: This project aims to explore the population structure and ancestry of the Caucasian varieties of grapevine using WGS data. The participants will become familiar with the VCF file format, the standard data preprocessing pipeline (variant calling, filtering) and the downstream population genomics analyses (ADMIXTURE, phylogenetic tree construction).
 
## GP4: Dissecting Lung Cancer Heterogeneity via Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling

 - Mentors: Arpine Grigoryan, Melina Tamazyan, Sveta Mnatsakanyan, Luiza Stepanyan
 - Students (will be added)
 - Short description: Investigate the cellular heterogeneity of lung cancer by analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, identify the key genes, cell populations, and molecular pathways that contribute to the development and progression of lung cancer.
