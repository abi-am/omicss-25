# Dissecting Lung Cancer Heterogeneity via Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling
Lung cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers worldwide, yet its complexity at the cellular level remains poorly understood. Single-cell transcriptomics provides a powerful approach to uncover rare cell populations, tumor heterogeneity, and interactions within the tumor microenvironment, insights that are essential for improving diagnosis and treatment strategies.

explores the cellular diversity of lung cancer using scRNA-seq data. 
By analyzing gene expression at the single-cell level, we aim to identify key cell types, genes, and molecular pathways involved in tumor development and progression.
