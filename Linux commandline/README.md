# Welcome to the Linux Command Line Course (omics-25)

## 📚 Lecture

Before starting the course, we will have an introductory lecture covering the basics of computer systems, the Unix operating system, and its historical development. The session will also provide an overview of modern Linux distributions that are actively used in bioinformatics.

## 🔐 Generating an SSH Key Pair

Please follow the provided instructions to generate your SSH key pair (public and private).

🔗 [How to Generate an SSH Key Pair](https://github.com/abi-am/it-resources/blob/main/access-to-server/howto.md)

After generating the keys, email your **public key** to:

📧 **antranigv@abi.am**

---

## 🌐 Connecting to the Server

After submitting your public key, you will receive an email with all the necessary information to connect to the server.

### 🔧 For Windows Users

If you're using Windows, we recommend installing **MobaXterm** to connect to the server.  
Follow this setup guide:

🔗 [MobaXterm Setup Guide](https://github.com/abi-am/it-resources/blob/main/access-to-server/windows-users.md)

### 💻 For macOS/Linux Users

You can connect directly using your terminal. Use the following command:

```bash
ssh -l yourusername@comp1.abi.am
```
⚠️ **Note:** Replace `yourusername` with the username you received via email.

## Command Line: Introductory Materials

Once you're logged into the server, it's a great time to start practicing basic command-line usage.

The following resources will help you become familiar with the Linux terminal environment:

- 📖 **Reading Material:**

## 🧰 Tmux: Terminal Multiplexer

When working on multiple projects or running long jobs on a server, it's important to keep your sessions active even if you disconnect. **Tmux** helps you do exactly that.

### Benefits of Tmux

- Split your terminal into multiple panes  
- Run and resume sessions remotely  
- Keep your work persistent across logins
