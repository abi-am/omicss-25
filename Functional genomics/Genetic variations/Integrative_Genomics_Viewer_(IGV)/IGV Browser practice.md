## Step 1
Open files wes46_dedup.bam and wes78_dedup.bam in the IGV browser, they should appear one under another

## Step 2
Use navigation box to choose gene responsible for Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)

## Step 3
Describe what kind of variants are there?

## Step 4
Answer why are there variants in intron regions, when it is WES?

## Step 5
Try to find homozygous somatic mutations

## Step 6 
Are the common variants among two sample?

## Step 7
What do you think about coverage of variants? Are there true or false variants?

## Step 8
Try to find variants that are not present in the corresponding VCF file. Why are they absent?

## Step 9
For variants in exome regions present in both .bam and .vcf files write the variant coordinates, describe the variant, specify reference sequence, variant coverage and variant quality.

## Step 10
Try to assume what variant/variants drive the FMF disease and in what sample
