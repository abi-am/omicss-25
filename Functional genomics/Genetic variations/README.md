Genomic variations are the differences in DNA sequence—such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and structural rearrangements—that distinguish individuals or populations and underlie traits, evolution, and disease. Variant calling is the computational process of comparing high-throughput sequencing reads to a reference genome to detect and catalog these variations with quality metrics. Accurate variant calling transforms raw sequencing data into actionable biological insights for research and clinical applications.

### Lecture
[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iBj2Rdx6Ue0G7pYThBh_7XcEZjCzS00m/edit?slide=id.p1#slide=id.p1) you will find the slides on genomic variation and variant calling 

### Practice

In the **variant_calling** folder you will find the materials for the practical session.

- **variant_calling_pipeline.md** — a step-by-step guide to the variant-calling pipeline. All file paths are specified for their locations on the server where you will execute the commands.
