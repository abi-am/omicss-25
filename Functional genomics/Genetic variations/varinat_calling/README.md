**GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit)** is an open-source software suite from the Broad Institute for identifying genomic variants in high-throughput sequencing data. It provides best-practice workflows for read pre-processing, variant discovery, and genotyping across germline and somatic applications. Its modular tools and active community support have made GATK a standard in research and clinical genomics.

During this practical session you will perform variant calling on the *E. coli* dataset. A detailed, step-by-step workflow is provided in **variant_calling_pipeline.md**, and all required files are already available on the server.

> **Important:** The workflow shows how to index the reference genome during the alignment step. Because indexing is time-consuming, we have already completed this for youâ€”skip that command and continue with the next step.
