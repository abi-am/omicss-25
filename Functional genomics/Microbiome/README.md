## 📅 Schedule & Topics

### 📍 August 13, 2025

#### ⏰ 3:00 PM – 4:00 PM  
**Topic:** *Introduction to the Microbiome*  
**Presenter:** Raz Sargsyan  

**Objective:**  
To explore the microbiome field, introduce key concepts, and discuss current advancements. Participants will gain a foundational understanding of microbiome analysis.

---

#### ⏰ 4:00 PM – 5:00 PM  
**Topic:** *Amplicon Sequencing and Data Analysis*  
**Presenter:** Nelli Vardazaryan  

**Objective:**

### 📍 August 14, 2025

#### ⏰ 3:00 PM – 4:00 PM  
**Topic:** *Metagenomic Sequencing and Data Analysis*  
**Presenter:** Lilit Nersisyan  

**Objective:**  
To cover metagenomic sequencing techniques and introduce the **Kraken/Bracken** analysis pipeline. Participants will understand the principles of metagenomic data analysis.

**Practice Topics:**  
- **Phyloseq** basics  
- Creating a Phyloseq object  
- **Diversity Analyses:**  
  - Bar plots (composition plots)  
  - Alpha diversity (Shannon, Observed OTUs)  
  - Beta diversity (Bray–Curtis)

#### ⏰ 4:00 PM – 5:00 PM  
**Topic:** *Data Visualization with Phyloseq*  
**Presenter:** Davit Hakobyan  

**Objective:**  
To explore microbiome profiles using **Phyloseq**. Participants will learn how to construct Phyloseq object and perform basic visualizations commonly used in microbiome studies.

**Practice:**  
Vizualization will include:
- Composition plots (bar plots, relative abundance heatmaps)  
- **Diversity Analyses:**  
  - Alpha diversity (Shannon, Observed OTUs)  
  - Beta diversity (Bray–Curtis)
