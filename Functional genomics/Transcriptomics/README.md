# Welcome to the Transcriptomics Course (omicss-25)

## 📚 Lecture

We will give a lecture covering the basics of differential gene expression analysis, the DeSeq2 package, and their application to solving problems in big data biology.

## 🧰 Practice

In this practice, you will learn how to find differentially expressed genes using RNA-seq count data. You will use DESeq2 to test for differences between conditions and interpret results with log fold changes and p-values.
