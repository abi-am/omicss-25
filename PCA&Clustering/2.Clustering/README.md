# Clustering Module – Omics 25 Summer School

Welcome to the **Clustering** module of the Omics 25 Summer School! Following the PCA section, we now shift our focus to discovering structure in data through unsupervised learning techniques.

Clustering plays a vital role in bioinformatics — from identifying gene expression patterns and sample subtypes, to classifying cells in single-cell datasets. Understanding how to group similar data points can help generate meaningful biological insights from high-dimensional data.

## How to Proceed

To make the most out of this module, please follow the steps below:

### 1. Watch the Introductory Presentation
Begin by watching the **Clustering presentation** (`clustering_presentation.pdf`) provided in this folder. It introduces the key ideas behind clustering.

### 2. Explore Additional Learning Materials
Once you've seen the presentation, continue your learning with the **supplementary video list**.

Topics covered include:
- How different clustering algorithms work
- Choosing the number of clusters
- Evaluating clustering performance

### 3. Hands-on Practice with Python
Now it's time to apply what you've learned! Download the following files from this folder:

Now it's time to put your knowledge into action. In this step, you'll work through a set of **structured exercises** designed to deepen your intuition and practical understanding of clustering.

Download the file `clustering_exercises.pdf`  from this folder. Make sure all related resources (if any) are in the **same directory** to ensure everything runs smoothly.

These exercises cover:
- **Manual simulation of K-Means:** Perform one iteration using 2D points and calculate distances and new centroids.
- **Hands-on with 1D K-Means:** Go through two full iterations step by step.
- **Elbow Method:** Analyze how to choose the best value of K based on within-cluster variation.
- **Short theory questions:** Test your conceptual understanding of K-means.



These exercises are a great way to transition from theory to application and will help you prepare for more complex datasets in future analyses.
