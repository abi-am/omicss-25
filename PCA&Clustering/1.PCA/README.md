# PCA Module – Omics 25 Summer School
Welcome to the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) module of the Omics 25 Summer School! In this section, we will explore how PCA helps us make sense of complex omics datasets by reducing dimensionality and uncovering hidden patterns.

## How to Proceed
To get the most out of this module, please follow the steps below in order:

### 1. Watch the Introductory Presentation
Start by watching the presentation provided in this folder. It will give you a strong intuitive understanding of PCA — what it is, why it's useful in bioinformatics, and how it transforms high-dimensional data into something more interpretable.

### 2. Dive Deeper with Additional Videos
After the presentation, deepen your understanding by watching the supplementary videos. These videos cover key aspects of PCA, including:
* Geometric intuition
* Eigenvectors and eigenvalues
* Real-world applications in biology
