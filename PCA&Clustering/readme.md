# Welcome to Omics 25 Summer School – PCA and Clustering Section

We are delighted to welcome you to the PCA and Clustering section of the Omics 25 Summer School. Over the next two hours, you will dive into two essential data analysis techniques widely used in bioinformatics: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Clustering.

## Why PCA and Clustering Matter in Bioinformatics

In modern bioinformatics, the datasets we deal with are often high-dimensional and complex — think gene expression matrices, proteomic profiles, or epigenetic signatures. Clustering allows us to uncover hidden patterns in this data, such as identifying gene modules or sample subtypes. On the other hand, PCA is a powerful dimensionality reduction method that helps us simplify these large datasets, visualise trends, and reduce noise.

Together, PCA and Clustering form a foundational toolkit for making sense of biological variation, detecting subgroups, and generating hypotheses from omics data.

## What to Expect

In the next two hours, we will:
* Begin with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) — understanding its intuition, mathematics, and how it can help reduce complexity in omics datasets.
* Then transition into Clustering — exploring how we group similar observations, evaluate cluster quality, and interpret biological meaning.

Whether you're a beginner or brushing up your skills, this session will equip you with key insights and practical tools to apply these methods in your own research.

Let's get started!
