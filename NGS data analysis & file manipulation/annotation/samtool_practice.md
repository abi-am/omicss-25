# ðŸ§¬ SAMtools Practical Exercises

In this set of exercises, you will use **SAMtools** to explore and manipulate **SAM/BAM files**, which are standard formats for storing aligned sequencing reads. The tasks range from basic read counting to more advanced operations like extracting specific regions and identifying duplicate reads.

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 1: Count the Total Number of Aligned Reads

**Description:**  
Count how many reads in the BAM file are mapped to the reference genome. This gives you a quick overview of how many reads were successfully aligned.

<!--
Command:
samtools view -c -F 4 sample.bam

Explanation:
The `-F 4` flag excludes unmapped reads, and `-c` counts the remaining ones.
-->

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 2: Count Reads Mapped to Chromosome 1

**Description:**  
Determine how many reads are mapped specifically to chromosome 1. This is useful for examining chromosome-level coverage.

<!--
Command:
samtools view -c sample.bam chr1

Explanation:
This command filters reads by region (chromosome 1) and counts them with `-c`.
-->

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 3: Count Properly Paired Reads

**Description:**  
Identify how many reads are properly paired in the alignment (i.e., both mates mapped correctly). Proper pairing is a good indicator of library preparation and mapping quality.

<!--
Command:
samtools view -c -f 2 sample.bam

Explanation:
The `-f 2` flag selects reads that are marked as properly paired in the BAM file.
-->

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 4: Calculate Average Read Depth Over a Region on Chromosome 16

**Description:**  
Calculate the average sequencing depth across a defined region on chromosome 16. This helps assess whether a region has sufficient coverage for variant calling.

<!--
Command:
samtools depth -r chr16:1000000-2000000 sample.bam | awk '{sum+=$3} END {print sum/NR}'

Explanation:
`samtools depth` reports per-base coverage, and `awk` computes the average.
-->

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 5: Count Reads with Mapping Quality â‰¥ 30 on Chromosome 21

**Description:**  
Count how many reads are mapped to chromosome 21 with a mapping quality (MAPQ) score of at least 30. This helps assess the number of confidently aligned reads in a high-quality region.

<!--
Command:
samtools view -q 30 -c sample.bam chr21

Explanation:
The `-q 30` option filters reads with MAPQ â‰¥ 30; `-c` counts them on chr21.
-->

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 6 (Advanced): Extract and Sort Reads Mapped to a Specific Region

**Description:**  
Extract all reads mapped to a defined genomic region (e.g., chr2:1,000,000â€“2,000,000) and sort them by coordinate. This is helpful when focusing on a gene or region of interest.

<!--
Command:
samtools view -b sample.bam chr2:1000000-2000000 | samtools sort -o chr2_region_sorted.bam

Explanation:
The `view` command with region filters and `-b` outputs BAM format; `sort` arranges reads by position.
-->

---

## ðŸ”¹ Exercise 7 (Advanced): Identify Duplicate Reads and Count Them

**Description:**  
Mark duplicate reads in the BAM file and calculate how many are present. This helps assess library complexity and potential PCR amplification bias.

<!--
Commands:
samtools sort -o sorted.bam sample.bam
samtools fixmate -m sorted.bam fixmate.bam
samtools sort -o fixmate_sorted.bam fixmate.bam
samtools markdup fixmate_sorted.bam marked.bam
samtools view -c -f 1024 marked.bam

Explanation:
This pipeline first prepares the file for duplication marking, then `markdup` identifies duplicates, and `-f 1024` counts them.
-->
