  # TODO
-   Prepare slides and materials on FASTA/FASTQ files formats [Davit T., Tatevik J.]
     1. [P: FASTA/Q files manipulations - 8/8/2025 11AM-12PM] [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/147S8KHfASleNNnflGcAHNm_17RivY0Ik3SBDx_QqfxA/edit?slide=id.g33d5a1ad07d_0_177#slide=id.g33d5a1ad07d_0_177) - Difference between FASTA and FASTQ file structure (header, quality score, difference between reference and reads). Include common Linux commands for viewing (head, less), counting sequences/reads (grep), etc.
     2. [OH: Linux & FASTA/Q manipulation - 8/8/2025 12PM-1PM] Other Materials - Prepare small [sample data](https://github.com/abi-am/omicss-25/tree/d0419ab896f09ed672cb5552bba0791d006bc056/NGS%20data%20analysis%20%26%20file%20manipulation/exercises/sample_data) and [exercises for practice](https://github.com/abi-am/omicss-25/blob/d0419ab896f09ed672cb5552bba0791d006bc056/NGS%20data%20analysis%20%26%20file%20manipulation/exercises/fatsa_exercises.md) (e.g. view first 10 lines of the file, extract specific sequences, get chromosome names and respective lengths)
-   Prepare slides and materials on Quality Control (FastQC & MultiQC) [Mher K., Anahit Y.]
     1. [P: FASTQC & interpretation - 8/8/2025 3PM-4PM] [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17kIqHhE1-EcamWTcxxPEj-M4FjJvLYy7nw7EVw7beiY/edit?usp=sharing) - reasons for quality assesment, FASTQC & MULTIQC report interpretations and deciding on trimming/filtering parameters.
     2. [P: FASTQC & interpretation - 8/8/2025 4PM-5PM] Other Materials - Prepare small dataset (~5 samples), commands for running QC, and trimming with cutadapt/fastp. See tutorial [here](https://github.com/abi-am/omicss-25/blob/d0419ab896f09ed672cb5552bba0791d006bc056/NGS%20data%20analysis%20%26%20file%20manipulation/exercises/fastqc_tutorial.md).
 
-   Prepare slides and materials on Alignment and Samtools [Nate Z.]
     1. [P: Alignment - 8/11/2025 12PM-1PM] [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tNOKpZZuyiv5n5Cl6aCLpbwf8a-lcqGt/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=112677744829360659757&rtpof=true&sd=true) - FASTA of reference genome, SAM/BAM file format, aligning with BWA/Bowtie2, include basic Samtools commands (view, sort, index, depth). 
     2. [P: Samtools - 8/11/2025 2PM-4PM] Other Materials - Prepare sample reference and reads to perform alignment and practice basic samtools commands.

-   Prepare slides and materials on Annotation & genomic regions [Maria N.]
     1. [L: Annotation & genomic regions - 8/12/2025 11PM-12PM] [Slides]() - 
     2. [OH: Annotation - 8/12/2025 2PM-3PM] Other Materials - Prepare small dataset to perform annotation
