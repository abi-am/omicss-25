  NGS data analysis & file manipulation
-   FASTA/FASTQ file formats & manipulation on Linux [Davit T., Tatevik J.]
-   Quality Control (FASTQC, MULTIQC) & Interpretation [Mher K., Anahit Y.]
-   Alignment and Samtools [Nate Z., ]
  
  # TODO
-   Prepare slides and materials on FASTA/FASTQ files formats [Davit T., Tatevik J.]
     1. Slides - Difference between FASTA and FASTQ file structure (header, quality score, difference between reference and reads). Include common Linux commands for viewing (head, less), counting sequences/reads (grep), etc.  [June 23rd, 11AM] 
     2. Other Materials - Prepare small sample data and exercises for practice (e.g. view first 10 lines of the file, extract specific sequences, get chromosome names and respective lengths)

-   Prepare slides and materials on Quality Control (FastQC & MultiQC) [Mher K., Anahit Y.]
     1. Slides - reasons for quality assesment, FASTQC & MULTIQC report interpretations and deciding on trimming/filtering parameters [June 23rd, 11AM]
     2. Other Materials - Prepare small dataset (~5 samples), commands for running QC, and trimming with cutadapt/fastp.
 
-   Prepare slides and materials on Alignment and Samtools [Nate Z., ]
     1. Slides - FASTA of reference genome, SAM/BAM file format, aligning with BWA/Bowtie2, include basic Samtools commands (view, sort, index, depth). [June 23rd, 11AM]
     3. Other Materials - Prepare sample reference and reads to perform alignment and practice basic samtools commands.
