  # Contents
  This module introduces core algorithms and techniques in bioinformatics. The topics are structured over five days of instruction, combining theory with practice:

  ### Day 1: Sequence Comparison  
  - Exact matching algorithms  
  - Sequence alignment: concepts and types  
  - Global alignment using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (Dynamic Programming)

  ### Day 2: Local and Semi-Global Alignment  
  - Local alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm  
  - Semi-global alignment with a focus on read alignment scenarios

  ### Day 3: Seeds and Indexing  
  - Introduction to seed-based matching  
  - Indexing techniques (e.g., suffix arrays, hash tables) used before alignment

  ### Day 4: Genome Assembly  
  - Concepts and challenges in genome assembly  
  - Overlap-layout-consensus and de Bruijn graph-based methods

  ### Day 5: Phylogenetic Trees  
  - Principles of phylogenetic tree construction  
  - UPGMA method for building evolutionary trees
